                <p class="actualArticle">The girls soccer team entered the postseason with a 7-8 record, having achieved a berth to the state game in the year past. In sectionals they defeated Bishop Luers 3-0 and Blackhawk Christian 3-1 behind goals from 5 different players. Their two regional matchups against Eastbrook and Sheridan both ended in 1-0 victories, and the team eyed a semi-state matchup against the 17-3 Westview Warriors.

                    The game started around 2 PM at Chesterton High School with a large student section in attendance. Minutes into the game, Bontrager of Westview mishit a ball inside the 18, and it lightly spun over the head of Sofia Carver to give Westview an early 1-0 lead, which lasted into halftime.

                    Out of the gate of the second half, freshman Brady Ryland launched a long shot over the head of the keeper to tie the game at 1. Shortly after, senior Stella VandeWater set up for a free kick and sent a shot into the upper 90 to swiftly give Canterbury a 2-1 lead. Momentum continued for the Cavs as they extended their lead when a cross from Ryland was met by junior Sterling Waterfield, who hit the ball off her shin for an unexpected goal.

                    The Cavs maintained this lead as freshman goalkeeper Abby Eilers took over in goal and saved a few shots from the Warriors. Canterbury left with a momentous 3-1 victory over the previously dominant Westview.

                    Canterbury looks ahead to their state matchup against Park Tudor, who defeated them last year in the exact situation. This year, though, the Cavs enter the game with a chip on their shoulder and a want for redemption.
