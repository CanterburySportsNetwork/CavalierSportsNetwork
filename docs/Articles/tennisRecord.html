                    Roshens favorite memory this season: My favorite memory was the Carroll Invitational because we were able to play talented teams from around the state, and we did well and came together as a team
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How would you assess the season? The team did well overall as most of the team was stepping into new positions. We had many close matches that we were unable win that we should have, but overall I am happy with the season overall. Everyone improved as the season went on and gave 100 percent effort. Despite not winning sectionals, we played well against a very good team in homestead.
